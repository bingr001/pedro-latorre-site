      "There are some who spend their whole lives devoted to perfecting
      the gifts and talents that God has given them for one purpose and
      one purpose only — for their own benefit and success. There are
      others, like Pedro LaTorre, who devote their entire lives to taking
      those same gifts and talents and using it for the greater good. You
      won't find another guy more down to earth with his experience and
      accomplishments. He's humble and teachable, engaging and
      captivating, and his stories and message will compel you.

      <br/>
      He knows how to present the gospel in a unique way without
      distorting the very foundation of our faith. The Church is stronger
      with people like Pedro.”
